# Collective & Individual Topic Selection  
**DUE February 12**  
**PASS/FAIL Grade**

Your first task is to collaboratively determine the overall thematic focus of your group, as well as brainstorm some potential topics for your individual dataset. You will have time to work on this planning document in class and will submit it as a Markdown file in your group’s GitHub repository.

This planning document should address:

---

## Group Theme  

**What is your shared area of interest? What kinds of cultural objects, practices, or phenomena fall within this theme? What’s included and what’s beyond scope?**

Our group’s shared area of interest is **Music**.

### Included
- Popular music across genres / regions / time periods  
- Different platforms  
- Playlists / recommendations  
- Likes  

### Beyond scope
- Music theory (composition)  
- Copyright  

---

## Individual Ideas  

**What specific dataset is each group member considering? How do these relate to the group theme? Why this topic?**  
(These can be preliminary. You’ll develop them further as the semester progresses.)

### Eshaan  
I plan to analyze data from major music streaming platforms to examine how top genres have changed over the past 10 years (2015 - 2025). Using chart rankings and streaming statistics, I will identify long term trends in genre popularity and see whether these patterns can be used to predict future trend changes.

### Beau  
Using Spotify data to predict genres to recommend to users based on their current music preferences. Suggesting songs/mixes with new and/or preexisting genres to help the user expand their music taste. 

### Inika  
I plan to look at a top songs dataset and see what type of music is popular and why. I want to understand patterns in artist popularity and see which features of songs contribute to their popularity (song duration, genre etc).

### Ananya  
I want to study how being added to playlists affects how popular a song becomes on streaming platforms. Using Spotify playlist and chart data, I’ll look at whether songs featured on big curated playlists get more streams and attention than others. I picked it because I’m interested in how playlists influence what people end up listening to.

### Raymond  
I want to study the dark-horses among datasets of “trending” music, like those extracted from Spotify’s top lists. Artists with songs that average significantly less listens than are required to actually qualify for the top 200. I want to identify trends in dark-horse songs and potentially be able to algorithmically recommend more of these. 

### Zilong  
*(To be added.)*

### Rohan  
I’m gonna record my Spotify songs by my mood, time, where I’m getting them from, and any skips. This fits the music vibe by showing how I use playlists and recommendations. I chose this because it’s easy to collect data, personal, and relatable.

## Collaboration Plan  

**How will your group communicate and share progress? What’s your GitHub organization strategy?**

We made an iMessage group chat for easy communication. We will make sure to give ourselves internal deadlines and hold each other accountable to finishing them.

**Github organization:**  
- Individual folders for subtopic  
- Different folders for brainstorming, data, analysis, visualizations etc.
