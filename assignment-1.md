## Finding the Poetry  

Searched the name of the poem (“To Clarissa Scott Delany”) in HathiTrust but didn’t find the relevant mats. The search that produced the name of the broader magazine was adding the author name to the poem name in a Google search, which brought up *Ebony and Topaz, a collectanea*. We searched for this on HathiTrust, but they’re highkey gatekeeping the mats, as we were not able to access a digitized copy of *Ebony and Topaz* from HathiTrust.  

This presents another issue with digitization: even after we’ve digitized everything, there are materials published an eon ago that are right in front of our computer screens that are still under copyright, even when we were able to find exactly what was being protected through a Google search that led us to a copy on the Internet Archive.  

The poem is on page 67 🫴🫴.  

OCR looks good. The text on the OCR is accurate to the original aside from many formatting differences. There are sections that are labelled numerically for different verses, and the OCR was unable to capture ALL of the labels.  

There’s not much else on the page visually. The only information that’s destroyed by the OCR are the majority of the line breaks and two of the verse numbers. Potentially, these could help shape the flow of the poem, but I believe this is a case where creating a structured dataset would not significantly impact the content of the poem, in either a positive or negative way.  

**Metadata Available:**  
Publication Date, Topics, Publisher, Collection, Contributor, Language, Digital File Size, Physical Size, Added Date, Associated Names, Camera, OCR Info

### Finding the Poetry  

I searched up the name of the poem and it did show up but it took looking through multiple different editions of *The Crisis* to find.  

I also checked by looking up the words in the poem. This is when the OCR started getting really rough. The start of the poem goes:  

> “Alas, My Country! Thou wilt have no need Of enemy to bring thee to thy doom”  

But it misreads all of it.  

To start, the italicized text from the previous poem comes up as a bunch of gibberish and escape characters. It skips the giant A in *Alas* and misreads LAS in alas. The A eventually shows up in the following line after “have”.  

Additionally, there was a lot of additionally punctuation picked up by the OCR. Nearly every word is followed by a ; which does not appear in the text nor show a new line.  

Example OCR output:  

> “HMest awd My; Country;! Thou; wilt; have; A*- no need; Of; enemy; to; bring; thee; to; thy; doom; If these”  

By looking at the original work we can see the context of the poem and where it falls within the structure of the literary work. In this case we can see that the poem falls in a work that talks about African American accomplishments/news and this appears to be one of them.  

In a dataset we can see what themes are covered among other curated metadata.  

For this copy of *The Crisis* you could download the whole thing or individual selected paragraphs.  

In this case it is classified as public domain so there is no claim of copyright or any restrictions. Originally came from Cornell University.  

Honestly HathiTrust has a bunch of metadata on the book in the MARC catalog record but it’s mostly machine readable data that needs to be interpreted before it can be used.

## My Little One – by Georgia Douglas  

https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924055965465&seq=617&q1=My+little+one  

pg: 273 of the actual work or 617 of the total scan  

Overall the OCR is pretty good, the only issue is that the first letter T in “The infant” was not accurately read. Everything else including punctuation was flawless.  

An image of an infant holding a bear by the poem, doesn’t say who. The image is very clear. The rest of the page had a different story on it called *How I Grew My Corn*.  

Very short poem, searching for words in the poem was easy as well.  

Was able to download as pdf, no restrictions on it. Page had watermarks of Cornell University.

# Part 2  

## Digital Objects & Representations  

Some ideas for digital objects and digital representations in our field might include songs, playlists, lyrics, music sheets/compositions, and artists.  

Some digital objects and digital representations in the field of music and social media are songs, playlists, music videos, artist profiles, and engagement metrics.  

- **Songs (MP3, WAV files)** – These are direct digital representations of recorded music. They may be digitized from analog recordings or created digitally.  
- **Playlists (Spotify/Apple Music playlists)** – These are curated digital collections that show listening behavior, taste, and algorithmic recommendation systems.  
- **Music videos (YouTube, TikTok clips)** – These are audiovisual digital objects that shape how music spreads and trends.  

---

## Digitization Processes  

Digital objects in music and social media are created through several processes.  

**Audio Digitization** – Analog recordings are converted into digital files using analog-to-digital converters (ADC). Sound waves are sampled and encoded into formats such as MP3 or WAV. This process is similar to scanning a printed poem, but instead of converting text through OCR, it converts sound waves into numerical data.  

**Text Digitization** – Lyrics, album booklets, and sheet music are digitized through scanning and OCR. Similar to what was observed in HathiTrust, OCR errors can occur in lyrics databases, especially with stylized fonts or unusual formatting.  

**Social Media Encoding** – Videos and audio clips are compressed and formatted for platform compatibility. Algorithms analyze user engagement data to recommend content.  

Compared to HathiTrust, which focuses primarily on text extraction and preservation, music digitization includes audio encoding, visual compression, metadata structuring, and algorithmic distribution. It is both archival and interactive.

## Historical Equivalents  

Historical equivalents to digital music objects include sheet music, vinyl records, cassettes, radio broadcasts, and music magazines.  

- **Sheet music** – Before recordings were widely available, sheet music was the primary way music was written and distributed. It is comparable to downloadable PDF scores today.  
- **Vinyl records and cassettes** – These were physical storage formats for recorded sound. Streaming services now function as digital equivalents, storing music in remote servers rather than physical discs.  

The major difference is accessibility and scale. Historical formats were physical and localized, while digital music objects are global, searchable, and measurable.

## Born-Digital Materials  

Born-digital materials in music and social media include content that was created digitally and never existed in analog form.  

Examples include:  
- TikTok sounds created directly in the app  
- Instagram live performances  
- SoundCloud-only releases  
- AI-generated music  

Unlike digitized vinyl or scanned sheet music, these materials originate digitally. They are often shorter, optimized for platform algorithms, and dependent on user interaction.  

Digitized objects preserve past material, while born-digital objects define current cultural production. Born-digital music is often shaped by trends, algorithm visibility, and platform-specific features, which distinguishes it from historical digitization efforts focused on preservation.

## Oldest Digital Library/Archive  

The IUMA (Internet Underground Music Archive), which started in 1993, is considered the first free, high-quality music archive on the web.  

**Maintenance and Updates:**  
IUMA provided a way for independent musicians to share music with fans direct from their own home before the major streaming era started; as such, it was the first site of its kind and one of the pioneers of this new way to promote music. It was successful until too many times it was sold and could not maintain itself; after selling it, the majority of its collection has been saved or rescued by the Internet Archive to make sure it would not disappear forever.  

**Metadata and Standards:**  
IUMA and early archives like CANTUS were predominantly run on only basic Descriptive Metadata (artist, title of song, genre). In years past, these systems converted to more complex standards like MARC (used in libraries) and EBUCore (for the specific needs of broadcast and radio).

## Newest Digital Library/Archive  

There are quite a number of Digital Libraries other than That Pitch (which serves both as a Digital Library (Sync Licensing) for using music in Film/Advertising as well as being an incredibly new and specialized platform in 2026).  

**How Library Size Has Evolved:**  
The previous version of IUMA was the simplest type of repository/library; however, the new Digital Libraries have expanded their size and capacity and offer users a superior means of finding content through algorithms.  

**How Metadata Has Evolved:**  
IUMA and earlier versions of Online Databases have depended on traditional tagging methods to organize archives; however, new Digital Libraries have implemented both Technical Metadata (bitrate, file structure) and Administrative Metadata (licensing rights/permissions) to facilitate licensing of materials quickly and simply, as Administrative Metadata will be added automatically to song files.

## Viral Examples  

An example of a viral digital music item is Napster (1999), a peer-to-peer file-sharing service.  

**What Happened:**  
Napster allowed individuals to connect directly to computers where songs were stored on the user’s hard drive; in essence, each user’s hard disk becomes part of a gigantic, distributed repository for every song. Napster went viral due to its ability to allow individuals to easily locate and download virtually any song for free.  

**How It Affected the Music Industry:**  
The traditional music business was negatively impacted by what became known as the “slashdotted” effect (also known as “slashdot effect”) by the combination of both an extremely dramatic surge of traffic due to digital distribution and this sudden crash of the traditional music model. As a result, the recording companies began creating legitimate and high-quality digital music repositories, such as the iTunes Store and eventually Spotify, in order to provide the consumer with a legal alternative to the viral activity associated with Napster.

## Free vs. Proprietary Access  

There are two types of archives available to users:  

- Free/public archives that allow listeners to access historical recordings for free, such as the Internet Archive (audio archive), UC Santa Barbara's Cylinder Audio Archive.  
- Proprietary archives which consist of commercially operated proprietary libraries/platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Tidal.  

The two archives differ in their methods of access: free/public archives often allow the user to download files (FLAC or MP3) of recordings for personal use and are not restricted in this usage; whereas proprietary libraries operate on a "gatekeeping" basis and charge subscribers for the right to stream music, and the subscriber does not actually own the digital object (for example, if an artist withdraws their library from a proprietary archive because the artist no longer has a licensing agreement with the archive).
