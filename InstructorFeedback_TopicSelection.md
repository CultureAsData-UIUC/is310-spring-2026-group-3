# Instructor Feedback on Group & Individual Topic Selection

## Group Feedback

Overall, this is a strong group theme that aligns well with the course's goals. Your focus on music as mediated through digital platforms—–streaming services, playlists, recommendations, and engagement metrics—–shows thoughtful alignment with the course emphasis on culture, meaning, and data. I especially appreciate how clearly you've distinguished between what is in scope (popular music across genres, regions, and time periods; platform dynamics; playlists and recommendations; engagement) and what is out of scope (music composition/theory and copyright). This demonstrates that you're thinking about music as a site of cultural practice and consumption, not as a technical or legal artifact.

That said, there are several areas where your framing could become more conceptually precise and better grounded in music studies and information science scholarship.

1. **The Spotify Problem: Platform Power and the Politics of Taste-Making**

The most striking pattern in your proposals is that nearly every group member is focused on Spotify data. This creates a potential conceptual problem: you've framed your theme as "Music," but you're actually studying "Music as Mediated by Spotify." The risk is treating streaming platforms as neutral venues for music discovery and consumption. From an Information Sciences perspective, platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music are not passive intermediaries—they are infrastructures with:

- Proprietary recommendation algorithms that privilege certain songs and artists
- Complex licensing and payment models that reward some genres and artists while marginalizing others
- Curated editorial playlists that function as gatekeepers of visibility
- Data collection practices that commodify listener behavior
- Ownership structures that determine how profits are distributed
- Content moderation and censorship practices (often invisible to listeners)

In other words, music culture on digital platforms is not only about artist creativity, listener preference, and genre evolution—it's also about who controls the infrastructure, who benefits economically, and how visibility and value are structured. When you study "popularity" or "trends," you're studying what Spotify's algorithms have made visible and accessible, not some natural or neutral measure of cultural value. I'm not saying you can't use Spotify data—–it's a rich source for understanding contemporary music consumption. But you need to be explicit that you're studying music culture as constructed by and visible through Spotify, not music culture in general. Incorporating even basic awareness of platform power and its limitations will significantly strengthen your work.

2. **Operationalizing "Popularity" and What Counts as Popular**

Your description of the group theme as "popular music across genres, regions, and time periods" is a good starting point, but it would be helpful to unpack what you mean by "popular" and what role platforms play in constructing that popularity. Multiple group members use terms like "popular," "trending," "top songs," and "chart rankings" without defining what these actually mean or how they're measured. This is a critical oversight. Popularity is not a natural fact—it's a constructed metric that different platforms, institutions, and audiences measure differently.

When you say a song is "popular," what do you mean? Stream counts? But then are you measuring raw numbers vs. unique listeners vs. repeat plays, etc.? Chart position? But which chart? Billboard? Spotify's internal charts? Genre-specific charts? Playlist inclusion? Then how do you distinguish algorithmic playlists vs. editorial playlists vs. user playlists? Social media presence? Is that TikTok usage, Twitter mentions, YouTube views? Critical acclaim? Are you looking at reviews from music critics, awards won, media coverage? Cultural impact? Are you measuring covers, samples, memes, longevity? Economic value? Are you looking at revenue generated, concert ticket sales?

Each of these measures something different, and they often don't align. A song can have massive streaming numbers but no cultural staying power. A song can be critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful. A song can go viral on TikTok without charting on Spotify. You need to be explicit about which dimension of popularity you're examining and why that particular measure matters.

So I would recommend spending some time thinking about the conceptual framework for your group theme. What does "popular music" actually mean in the streaming era? How do platforms mediate and construct that popularity? What are the power dynamics at play in determining which music gets promoted and which gets marginalized? This will help you all develop more focused and insightful individual projects that connect to broader questions about culture, power, and technology.

3. **Engage with Published Scholarship**

This topic sits at the intersection of music studies, media studies, platform studies, and information science, so there is a rich body of scholarship you can draw on. I would encourage you to start engaging with key works in these fields early on, especially those that critically analyze music streaming, curation, and recommendation systems.

Some starting points to consider:

- Seaver, Nick. *Computing Taste: Algorithms and the Makers of Music Recommendation*. University of Chicago Press, 2022. (Available through the library)
- Morris, Jeremy Wade. "Curation by Code: Navigating Musical Taste in Streaming Recommendation Systems." *New Media & Society* 22, no. 12 (2020): 2262–2281. [https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444820951065](https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444820951065)

You should also look at journals like *Popular Music*, *Popular Music and Society*, *New Media & Society*, *Critical Studies in Media Communication*, and *Big Data & Society* for more recent work on streaming platforms, algorithms, and music consumption.

4. **Working with Existing Datasets: Verification and Augmentation**

I notice that most of you are planning to work with existing streaming datasets (Spotify API, chart data, top songs datasets). This is a reasonable approach, but it comes with specific responsibilities for this course. Since the course requires you to either create data or meaningfully augment existing data, you'll need to think carefully about:

- Who created these datasets? How were they constructed? What was included and excluded? What biases or limitations might exist?
- How do the datasets you choose align with the platforms' business interests? For instance, are certain genres, artists, or regions over-represented because they're more profitable or easier to track?
- Are there missing values, inconsistencies, or errors? How complete is the coverage?
- How will each of you augment these existing datasets? This could involve collecting additional data, integrating data from multiple sources, or enriching data with contextual information (artist background, regional trends, historical context, etc.).

Simply using an existing dataset as-is does not meet the course requirements. Each of you will need to articulate specifically what you're adding, verifying, or expanding. I'll provide individual feedback on augmentation strategies for each project.

Your collaboration plan seems sound and appreciate that you shared that you are using iMessage and setting internal deadlines. I also like the idea of individual topics, though you might consider folders for each student's dataset rather than subtopic (though I like the subtopic approach as well!).

## Individual Feedback

### Eshaan

I like your focus on long-term genre popularity trends and the temporal scope (2015–2025) is particularly interesting—–this period captures the transition from mixed ownership/streaming models to streaming dominance, platform algorithm consolidation, and the rise of TikTok as a music discovery engine. However, you need to clarify what you mean by "genre" and "popularity," and think critically about your data sources.

First, what data are you planning to use? You mention "chart rankings and streaming statistics," but which charts and which platforms? Billboard Hot 100? Spotify's global top 50? Apple Music charts? YouTube Music? Different charts reflect different things: Billboard measures a mix of sales, streaming, and radio airplay weighted toward U.S. audiences; Spotify's charts reflect platform-specific streaming; YouTube captures a different user base. You need to be specific about your data sources and think about what each one actually measures and what it's missing. As I mentioned above, if you are using existing data you will need to think carefully about how you are verifying and augmenting it to meet the course requirements. Platforms like Spotify do have some public data available, but it's limited and often doesn't include historical trends or detailed metadata. So you will need to consider how to overcome these proprietary data limitations.

To help you assess existing datasets, you might think more carefully about how these categories like "genre" and "popularity" are constructed. How will you define what counts as a "genre"? Are you using platform categorizations (which vary by platform and change over time), music industry standard classifications, or something else? Genre is a contested category that changes over time—–what Spotify calls "pop" in 2015 may look very different from what they call "pop" in 2025. You'll need to verify how your dataset categorizes genres and consider whether those categories make sense for your analysis. Similarly, what does "popularity" mean exactly? Streaming counts? Chart position? Cultural impact? These measure different things. A song could be streamed millions of times by bots or playlists but have limited genuine listener engagement. Conversely, a song could be hugely culturally significant without dominating streaming metrics. Which measure of popularity are you actually examining? What confounding factors might affect trends? Are you accounting for the growth of streaming itself? In 2015, streaming was still being adopted by many listeners; by 2025, it's ubiquitous. Raw streaming counts can't be compared directly across this period because the total user base, usage patterns, and technical capabilities changed dramatically. Similarly, the rise of TikTok in the late 2010s changed how music discovers audiences. I do not expect you to resolve these issues but these types of questions are important to consider as you evaluate existing datasets and think about how to verify and augment them meaningfully.

For verification, you might consider trying to triangulate your data with multiple sources. For instance, if you're using Spotify's charts, you could compare them to Billboard charts or YouTube Music trends to see if they align. You could also look at media coverage (which songs/genres are being written about in music journalism?) or social media discussions (which genres are being discussed on Twitter/Reddit/TikTok?) to help contextualize popularity. This would help you assess how popularity is being constructed. Similarly, you could also look at how platforms like Spotify categorize genres by look at the various features they use to classify songs (tempo, energy, danceability, etc.) and see how those features correlate with genre classifications. This would help you understand how genre is being constructed by the platform.

Once you have your data though there is a bigger issues of how you focus on trying to predict future trends. While I understand the impulse as it is interesting to explore, you might instead consider the complexity of music data and why prediction would be very difficult beyond quite reductive findings (e.g., "pop songs with a tempo of 120 BPM are more likely to be popular"). Music trends are influenced by countless factors beyond just the audio features of songs: artist popularity, marketing campaigns, social media virality, cultural moments, global events, platform algorithm changes, and more. Predicting future trends based on historical data alone is likely to be very difficult and may not yield meaningful insights. 

Instead of prediction, you might orient towards how could you meaningfully augment these datasets. For instance, you could collect additional data on media coverage, social media discussions, or artist demographics to see how these factors correlate with genre trends. You could also do a qualitative analysis of specific songs or artists that defy genre conventions or popularity trends to understand what might be going on in those cases. This would allow you to generate insights about the cultural dynamics of music trends rather than just trying to predict them. You might also narrow your focus to specific moments or turning points in the decade rather than trying to analyze the entire period.

Depending on how your project develops, you might consider reaching out to Prof. Tess McNulty in English who works on virality on TikTok and Youtube to see if she has any recommendations. Similarly, there's quite a bit of work in computational literary studies and DH on genre formation that might be helpful. Overall, I think you need to concretize your research question and think critically about your data sources, verification strategies, and augmentation plans. Happy to discuss further as you develop this!

Your focus on building a genre recommendation system is interesting and connects well to broader questions about how platforms mediate musical discovery. However, your framing is a bit unclear—–are you building a recommendation system from scratch, analyzing Spotify's existing recommendation system, or using Spotify data to train a predictive model? These are very different projects with different challenges, and only some of them fit within the scope of this assignment.

I have built recommendation systems for cultural data so that goal is laudable but you will need to think carefully about what that means for creating or augmenting data. For instance, you mention user preferences but how will you get such data? Spotify's API does not provide access to individual user listening histories or preferences, but this course does not allow for survey based data due to IRB restrictions. So are you building this solely for your own listening history? Or do you have a dataset of public user preferences that you can use? Each of these approaches has different implications.

If you are using your own listening history, then you will need to think carefully about both protecting your own privacy but also how will you augment that data? You might consider collecting additional contextual data about the songs you listen to (artist background, genre, release date, social media discussion) to enrich your dataset and allow for more meaningful recommendations. This would also help you think about recommendations not just as statistical pattern matching but as culturally situated choices. If you are using a public dataset of user preferences, then you will need to think about the limitations of that dataset and how you will verify its quality and representativeness. You will also need to think about how to augment that dataset meaningfully, perhaps by integrating it with additional contextual data as mentioned above.

I like your focus on recommendation systems so you might consider how this data helps your reverse engineer Spotify's recommendation system. What patterns do you see in Spotify's recommendations? How do they align with your own preferences and the data you have collected? This would allow you to critically analyze how Spotify's algorithms shape music discovery rather than just building a recommendation system from scratch. If you do approach your project from this angle though I will caution you that you will need to think very critically about how Spotify constructs genres and how that affects recommendations. Spotify's genre classifications are not objective—–they are constructed by Spotify's engineers based on a mix of audio features, metadata, and business interests. This means that any data you build using Spotify's genre classifications will inherit those biases and limitations. You will need to think critically about how to work with these classifications and whether you want to try to create your own genre categories based on different criteria.

It may be helpful to think about what even motivates a recommendation. Is it just about matching audio features? Or are there other factors at play (artist popularity, social media trends, cultural moments)? What does it mean for a recommendation to be "good"? Is it about user satisfaction? Diversity of recommendations? Discovering underrepresented artists? This would help you think more critically about the goals and values of your recommendation system.

I would highly recommend spending some time thinking about whether you plan to create data from scratch and/or augment existing data, and how you will verify the quality of your data. This is a critical part of the assignment and will shape the direction of your project. I also think narrowing your focus will be key to making this project manageable and meaningful. I would highly recommend taking a look at the work of Nick Seaver on music recommendation systems (linked above), as well as research on recommendation systems in other cultural domains (film, books) to see how scholars have approached this. Happy to discuss further!

### Inika

Your focus on what makes songs popular—–examining how features like genre, duration, and other song characteristics correlate with popularity—–is a solid analytical question. This could generate genuine insights about streaming platform culture. However, you need to be more specific about your dataset, your variables, and what you mean by "popularity."

You mention "a top songs dataset," but which one? There are many available on Kaggle and elsewhere. Is it a Spotify dataset? Billboard chart data? YouTube Music? Different datasets measure different things and will give you different answers. You need to identify your specific dataset and verify its quality and sources. Once you do, check: How was it constructed? What metadata is included? How current is it? What time period does it cover? What shaped the selection of songs included? This will help you understand the limitations and biases of your data.

But I would encourage you to think about popularity and top songs a bit more critically. What does it actually mean for a song to be "popular"? As I listed above, there a number of political, economic, social, and algorithmic factors that shape which songs become popular on streaming platforms. Simply correlating song features with popularity metrics rarely reveals much about the underlying dynamics. So you might consider, what does it mean for an organization like Billboard to release top songs charts? How does such data function in the music industry? In essence, lists of top songs might tell you more about the music industry's marketing and promotion strategies than about inherent qualities of the songs themselves or user preferences. You might also consider the increase of attempts to "game" these charts to understand the complexities and limitations of these datasets.

I did appreciate that you mentioned specific features like genre and duration, but again I remain perplexed where you will find this data. Are you planning to use Spotify's audio features? If so, you will need to verify how those features are generated and what they actually measure. Spotify's audio features are machine-generated measurements that Spotify engineers have built—they're not objective measurements of music. Are they reliable? What do they actually measure? Spotify has no incentive to make these transparent or accurate beyond their business needs. So you will need to think critically about how to work with these features and whether they are meaningful for your analysis. Previous students have sometimes done work on modeling individual song's audio features, so you might try that approach for verification.

A bigger question remains over how you plan to augment this data. You will need to think about what additional data you can collect to contextualize these datasets. For instance, you could collect data on artist popularity, marketing campaigns, social media trends, or cultural moments to see how these factors interact with song features and popularity. This would allow you to generate more nuanced insights about what makes songs popular in the streaming era. Generally though you should consider how you will narrow your scope. What you describe could be enough work for multiple researchers' careers, so you will need to think carefully about what is feasible and meaningful to analyze within the scope of this project. You might consider focusing on a specific genre, time period, or platform to make your analysis more manageable and insightful. Happy to discuss further as you develop this!

Your focus on how curated playlists affect song popularity is a genuinely interesting angle on platform power and music discovery. This gets at important questions about gatekeeping, visibility, and how platforms shape cultural value. 

Your hypothesis—–that being added to big curated playlists increases streams and attention—–seems intuitive. But it might worth considering the reverse: Spotify might add already-popular songs to curated playlists to capitalize on their popularity, rather than playlists creating popularity. Or both might be driven by a third factor: songs with strong marketing campaigns both get added to playlists AND get promoted through other channels. How will you disentangle these possibilities? 

I think at its core the angle that will help you narrow is thinking about what data exists versus what data you might actually create. I am pretty certain that Spotify's API does not provide comprehensive data about playlist placements, historical stream counts, or the dynamics of how songs move in and out of playlists over time; though you might double check. But if that is the case, then you will need to think creatively about how to verify and augment existing data to get at your question. For instance, you might consider collecting data on a specific set of playlists (e.g., Spotify's top editorial playlists) and tracking which songs are added over a specific time period. You could then analyze how those songs perform in terms of streams, social media engagement, and media coverage before and after playlist placement. This would allow you to generate insights about the relationship between playlist placement and popularity without needing access to proprietary data.

But you might also want to try another angle: what is the lifecycle of songs on playlists generally? How long do songs stay on playlists? How do they move between different types of playlists (editorial, algorithmic, user-generated)? This would allow you to analyze the dynamics of playlist curation and how it shapes music discovery over time. It doesn't get at your interest in attention as much, so this is just a suggestion. If you want to keep the focus on "attention", it might be worth considering how you will measure attention. Streams are one measure, but you could also look at social media engagement (Twitter mentions, TikTok videos, Reddit discussions), media coverage (reviews, features), or even concert ticket sales as additional measures of attention. You could also look at how for instance going viral on TikTok or being featured in a TV show interacts with playlist placement to affect attention. This would allow you to generate a more nuanced understanding of how different forms of visibility interact in the streaming era.

Like your group members, you will need to decide if you are creating data from scratch or verifying and augmenting existing data. While I've shared some ideas for creating data from scratch, if you are verifying and augmenting existing data, you should also think about how you will verify existing datasets. Many of these were scraped randomly so you might need to consider what these datasets actually represent and how they were constructed. For instance, if you're using a dataset of songs on Spotify's editorial playlists, you will need to verify how that dataset was created, what time period it covers, and what metadata is included. 

I would generally encourage you to try and concretize your research question and think critically about your data sources, verification strategies, and augmentation plans. There's some research I've been part of looking at what is at the top of GoodReads so happy to share that with you if you're interested in how to analyze curated lists. Overall though I think you are asking interesting questions so happy to discuss further as you develop this!

### Raymond

I like your focus on "dark horses" in streaming and think it is a clever angle that could reveal some interesting patterns about how these top trending lists operate. One thing that is a bit unclear is if you are interested in particularly artists who game this system or more so songs that are on these lists despite low streams. The two likely overlap, but it would be helpful to clarify. 

So my first piece of feedback is for your define "dark horse". You write "Artists with songs that average significantly less listens than required to actually qualify for the top 200." This is a good starting point, but it needs to be more precise. What exactly do you mean by "significantly less listens"? Are you defining this as songs that appear on a "trending" or "top" list despite having below-median streaming numbers? If so, which list? Spotify's weekly top 50? Billboard Hot 100? A platform's own "trending now" section? Different platforms rank differently, and their algorithms are proprietary and opaque. You need to identify a specific ranking system and understand how it works. Similarly, what constitutes a stream is also platform dependent. Spotify counts a stream after 30 seconds of play, but other platforms might have different thresholds. You will need to verify how streams are counted and what the thresholds are for being included in these top lists. This will help you define your "dark horses" more precisely and understand the dynamics at play.

From there it would be worth considering how a song would end up on a top list despite low streams. This is a critical question because it gets at the heart of how these lists are constructed and what they actually represent. If you find that there are indeed "dark horses" on these lists, then you will need to investigate why that is the case. Is it due to algorithmic quirks? Curation bias? Regional trends? Social media virality? Economic influence of certain labels or artists? It may be that you don't know initially and that first identifying the dark horses will help you start to consider the mechanisms at play. Part of this work will also be verifying these top streaming datasets. You will need to try and assess the accuracy of those lists, as well as what is left out or missing from the data. 

And then the next question becomes how will you augment this data. Your interest in dark horses could become a natural angle to either combine with multiple other relevant datasets (though those would also need to be verified) or to collect new data on these dark horses. For instance, you could collect data on the artists behind these songs (genre, label, social media presence), the songs themselves (audio features, lyrical content), and the context around their release (marketing campaigns, cultural moments). This would allow you to generate insights about what might be going on with these dark horses and why they are able to achieve visibility despite low streams.

I will caution you though on your desire to "algorithmically recommend more of these." This is a very ambitious goal that may not be feasible within the scope of this project. Building a recommendation system that can identify and promote "dark horses" would require access to proprietary data and algorithms from platforms like Spotify, which is unlikely. It would also require a deep understanding of how these platforms' recommendation systems work, which is difficult given their opacity. Instead, you might consider focusing on analyzing the patterns and characteristics of these dark horses, and that data could eventually become the basis for thinking more critically about how recommendation systems could be designed to promote underrepresented songs. Though again it depends if your interest is more on underrepresented songs or artists who game the system. If it's the latter, then you might want to focus more on the strategies these artists use to get on these lists despite low streams, which could be a fascinating angle on how artists navigate and manipulate platform dynamics.

Highly suggest as a first step of identifying actual datasets and working to narrow your focus. From there you can start to define your terms and think critically about how to verify and augment your data. Happy to discuss further as you develop this!

I like your focus on self-datafication of your listening patterns on Spotify. I think your focus on mood, vibes, time, and skip is all potentially fascinating, and could open up interesting questions of how we datafy ourselves through our interactions with platforms. This is a very unique angle!

The big question though becomes how will you represent your features and how much diversity will you have in your data? To answer this, you might consider more about what is the purpose of this data collection. Is there a certain pattern you are curious about? For instance, are you interested in how your mood affects your genre choices? Or how time of day affects your listening habits? Or how location shapes your music consumption? Or how skips correlate with certain features of songs? Each of these questions would require different data collection and analysis strategies, so it would be helpful to clarify what you're trying to learn from this data. Especially since it will be potentially easy to be reductive: I listen to sad songs when I'm sad, but that doesn't necessarily reveal much about the complexities of music consumption. So you might want to consider how many factors shape your listening patterns and how you can capture that complexity in your data collection and analysis. For instance, you might want to consider how external factors (social media trends, cultural moments, recommendations) interact with your internal factors (mood, time, location) to shape your listening habits. Also how platforms like Spotify's recommendation algorithms interact with your personal data to shape what you listen to.

Part of refining your topic is also considering scale and consistency. Collecting personal data over time can be labor-intensive, so you will need to think about how long you want to collect this data and how you will ensure consistency in your data collection. For instance, if you're manually recording your mood, how will you ensure that you're doing it consistently and accurately? Will you use a specific scale or categorization? How will you account for changes in your mood or listening habits over time? These are important questions to consider as you develop your data collection strategy.

You also need to consider your own privacy and how you will protect it. Collecting personal data about your listening habits, mood, and location can be sensitive, so you will need to think about what to *not* collect. In a few weeks, we will be working on ways to computationally collect manual data, so that will hopefully assist you in thinking about how to collect and analyze this data. But you might also consider pulling data from the Spotify API, which would give you more detailed and accurate data about your listening habits. So you might consider doing some hybrid of manual and computational data collection to get a richer dataset while also protecting your privacy. I would generally encourage you to try and think about how to capture complexity in this data collection, rather than trying to flatten it into simple categories. Music consumption is a complex and multifaceted practice, so you will need to think about how to capture that complexity in your data collection and analysis. Also the second half of the course requires thinking about scale and computational methods, so working with the Spotify API could be a good way to start thinking about how to computationally collect and analyze this data while also giving you more detailed insights into your listening habits.

I would highly recommend taking a look at the *Dear Data Project* [https://www.dear-data.com/theproject](https://www.dear-data.com/theproject) for inspiration on how to collect and represent personal data in creative and meaningful ways. This project involved two designers who collected personal data about their daily lives and represented it through hand-drawn visualizations. It could give you some ideas for how to approach your own data collection and representation in a way that captures the nuances of your listening habits while also being visually engaging. Happy to discuss further as you develop this!
